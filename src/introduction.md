# Introduction

## The Complete History of Ethereum: From Vision to World Computer

In the summer of 2013, a nineteen-year-old programmer began imagining a blockchain that could do more than just transfer digital money. What started as frustration with Bitcoin's limitations would evolve into Ethereum—a global, decentralized computer that has processed trillions of dollars in value and spawned entirely new categories of applications.

This book tells the complete story of Ethereum, from its conceptual origins to its position as the foundation of Web3. Through detailed historical accounts, technical deep-dives, and human stories, we'll explore how a radical idea became reality.

## What You'll Learn

This comprehensive history covers:

- **The Genesis**: How Ethereum was conceived, funded, and built by a global team of pioneers
- **Technical Evolution**: The major upgrades, challenges, and breakthroughs that shaped the protocol
- **The Ecosystem**: DeFi, NFTs, DAOs, and the applications that defined each era
- **The People**: Profiles of key contributors and the community that built Ethereum
- **The Impact**: How Ethereum is reshaping finance, organizations, and the internet itself
- **The Future**: The roadmap ahead and Ethereum's place in technological history
